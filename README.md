My first Django web app following the instructions from the "Python Crash Course" book, which I recommend for beginners. 


At the time I deployed this app, I didnâ€™t know for sure what I was doing, specially about the CSS (bootstrap) and html parts. 

It was also my first Javascript, heroku and git experiences.
